        is a french artist born in 1994 in Provins, achieved his master's degree at the ESAM Caen/Cherbourg in 2018. As well interested by personal photographs then pictures from the Internet, from horror and thriller movies, Tom Nadam questions and studies the concept of montage. These iconics and common pictures are collected for their plastic qualities, their chromatic recurrences, their pictorial repetitions and their symbolics. He diverts them, interprets them and appropriates them through drawing. The notion of montage and collage emanates by the diversities of treatments and mediums on the same area. He uses drawing and painting as a language, a writing style, for narrative purposes. Superimpose or juxtapose two pictures commits a telling as confuse and abstract it could be. Tom Nadam maintains an ambiguity in his tellings which allow the spectators a reading and an appropriation.
