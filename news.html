                Knowing that I would stay in Fukuoka Japan for one month presented me with a challenge. That challenge required me to make friends with the other residents and have them sit for me to paint portraits. I had been thinking a lot about phenomenology and the relationship that it had with having someone sit in front of me as a reference for a painting. Phenomenology deals with what is happening to us in the exact moment. Maurice-Merleau-Ponty was a French philosopher who spent a great deal of time revising phenomenological concepts of knowledge and experience. He believed that phenomenology dealt with the perception of a combination of language with bodily awareness. This can be linked to the way we perceive contemporary life; which is mostly over digital platforms, and our bodily awareness that deals with the constant interaction between a human and a technological device. The abstraction that I used to paint these portraits were derived from a technological language that I had been developing. Without knowing who I would paint on my flight to Japan, I completed three paintings and named the show “Keys” as a reference to the key board symbols that interact with each one of the faces.

                My thesis work revolved around the duality of existence that my generation finds itself in. That duality is perpetuated by the over-use of technology and the toll it takes on the psyche. Day to day we find ourselves in a reality that switches from a virtual realm to the physical realm; between what we view and (mis)interpret on a screen to that which we see in real life. This intrigues me and simultaneously disturbs me on a conscious level. I started to question the way that we communicate and how it effects me. I displayed these effects through traditional methods by juxtaposing the ephemeral nature of the digital world with the everlasting nature of painting; an irony I can’t help but illuminate. I was able to paint from life in order to express what it feels like to live in a cold communication era. I believe that some of the best art stems from first hand experience. Every day I wake up I am faced with the intimate integration of technology into our lives, and the effects it has on my own life are felt with every hour, no matter how much I try to avoid it. I developed a language that portrayed this duality of existence through paint, using thick black “voids” to communicate the void we all find ourselves in daily. I also used a color palette that is inspired by the colors that are emitted off of a computer and/or television screen, emulating the glow we all seem so mesmerized by. Each of these elements worked together, ushering me along my journey towards my concept of self living in 2017.

                The Manhattan Graphics Center accepted me as a scholarship student for the spring of 2019. I was fortunate enough to take an 8 week Japanese wood block course lead by the artist Takuji Hamanaka. I completed an edition of 5 prints using a traditional Japanese woodblock process to render a print of a skull and pills composed of triangles, referencing a 3-D printed object.
